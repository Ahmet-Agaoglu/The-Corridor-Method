# The-Corridor-Method
This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of a novel method for line fitting under bounded-error constraints. It features the Corridor Method for accurately delineating the feasible parameter set (FPS) and provides solutions for estimating regression parameters for cases with unknown error distributions and normally distributed errors.
